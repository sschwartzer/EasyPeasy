# EasyPeasy
Weak and duplicated passwords scanner.

# Overview
EasyPeasy is a tool that scans for weak passwords by comparing the domain accounts' passwords to a database of common passwords.
The tool also scans for accounts with identical passwords.

The tool runs on PowerShell version 4 and up and use Invoke-DCSync to extarct passwords hashes from Active Directory.

Clear text passwords or password hashes are not revealed to the user or saved on disk.

# Usage:
The tool runs on PowerShell version 4 and up and must be executed with domain administrator's privileges.

Option 1 - from the command line:
- Open Windows PowerShell (PowerShell - with ExecutionPolicy ByPass, in order to do that, type  this command in PowerShell command line: "Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass"), and change directory to the one where the files are downloaded (for example: cd C:\Users\administrator\Downloads).
- Type ".\ep.ps1" and press Enter.

Option 2 - from the directory:
- Right click on ep.ps1, and click on 'Run with PowerShell' (PowerShell - with ExecutionPolicy ByPass).
